## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Studio One 7 Sample Rate

**Issue:** Studio One opens .dawproject files at its default sample rate (usually 44.1 kHz), ignoring the 48 kHz setting in the .dawproject XML.

**RehearseKit output is correct:**
- ✅ WAV files: 48000 Hz (verified with ffprobe)
- ✅ .dawproject XML: `<SampleRate value="48000">` set correctly
- ❌ Studio One ignores this setting (Studio One limitation)

**Workaround (5 seconds):**
1. Open .dawproject in Studio One 7
2. **Song → Song Setup** (Cmd+Return)
3. Change Sample Rate: 44.1 → **48.0 kHz**
4. Click OK
5. Done! Files play at correct sample rate

**Note:** This is a Studio One .dawproject import limitation, not a RehearseKit bug. The files are perfect quality (48 kHz/24-bit).

### WebSocket via HTTPS

**Issue:** When accessing via https://rehearsekit.uk, WebSocket shows "Not Secure" warning because it's using `wss://` but Cloudflare tunnel needs additional configuration.

**Impact:** No real-time progress updates on https://rehearsekit.uk (need to refresh page)

**Workarounds:**
1. **Use:** http://10.0.0.155:30070 for real-time updates
2. **Or:** Refresh page occasionally on https://rehearsekit.uk
3. **Or:** Configure Cloudflare tunnel WebSocket routing (see docs/CLOUDFLARE_WEBSOCKET_SETUP.md)

**Jobs still process successfully either way!**

## 🎸 The Complete Workflow

**YouTube → Studio One 7 in ~6 minutes:**

1. **Open:** https://rehearsekit.uk
2. **Paste:** YouTube URL
3. **Process:** 5-7 minutes (watch detailed progress)
4. **Download:** Click Download (works in Brave!)
5. **Extract:** ZIP with stems + .dawproject
6. **Open:** Double-click .dawproject
7. **Studio One opens** (shows 44.1 kHz initially)

## 🚀 RehearseKit is LIVE!

**The seamless YouTube → Studio One 7 workflow is in production!**

**Access:** https://rehearsekit.uk  
**Cost:** $0/month  
**Quality:** Professional-grade stems  

**Congratulations on a successful deployment!** 🎸🎵
