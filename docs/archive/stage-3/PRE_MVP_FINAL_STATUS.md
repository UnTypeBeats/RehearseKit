## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Studio One Sample Rate
**Problem:** Studio One 7 opens .dawproject files at 44.1 kHz instead of 48 kHz

**Root cause:** Studio One ignores .dawproject `<SampleRate>` element

**Evidence:**
- WAV files ARE 48 kHz (verified with ffprobe)
- .dawproject XML has `<SampleRate value="48000">` correctly set
- Studio One still uses its default 44.1 kHz

**Workaround:**
1. Open .dawproject in Studio One
2. Song ‚Üí Song Setup (Cmd+Return)
3. Change 44.1 ‚Üí 48.0 kHz
4. Click OK

**Time cost:** 5 seconds per project

**Severity:** Low (annoying but quick fix)

**Possible solutions to research:**
- Studio One native `.song` format (likely proprietary)
- `.multitrack` format
- Contact PreSonus support about .dawproject bug

### Issue 2: WebSocket "Not Secure" Warning on HTTPS
**Problem:** When accessing https://rehearsekit.uk, browser shows "Not Secure" warning

**Root cause:** WebSocket trying to connect via `ws://` instead of `wss://` through Cloudflare Tunnel

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Jobs still process successfully
- ‚ùå No real-time progress updates on HTTPS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Not Secure" warning in browser
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly on http://10.0.0.155:30070

**Workaround:**
- Use http://10.0.0.155:30070 for real-time updates
- Or refresh page on https://rehearsekit.uk to see progress

**Fix required:**
- Configure Cloudflare Tunnel with WebSocket support
- See: `docs/CLOUDFLARE_WEBSOCKET_SETUP.md`

**Severity:** Low (cosmetic, doesn't break functionality)

### Issue 3: No Authentication
**Problem:** Anyone can access https://rehearsekit.uk and create jobs

**Impact:**
- Open to internet abuse
- No user management
- Can't track who created which jobs
- Server resources could be exhausted

**Severity:** High for public deployment, Low for personal use

**Planned fix:** Google OAuth in MVP Stage 2

### Issue 4: Download in Brave Browser
**Problem:** Download button initially didn't work in Brave

**Root cause:** Brave's aggressive popup blocking

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (using fetch+blob method)

**Current:** Works in all browsers

### Issue 5: Stem Separation Quality
**Problem:** Guitars (clean/distorted) and synths combined in "other" track

**Root cause:** Demucs only produces 4 stems

**Impact:** Guitarists and keyboardists must manually separate parts

**Severity:** Medium (documented limitation)

**Planned fix:** Multi-model approach in MVP Stage 2

## üß™ Testing Summary

**Test Coverage:**
- 35 Playwright E2E tests
- 33 passing (100% of active tests)
- 2 skipped (GCP cloud tests - intentional)

**Manual Testing:**
- ‚úÖ YouTube ‚Üí Download workflow
- ‚úÖ Multi-format upload
- ‚úÖ Cancel/Delete functionality
- ‚úÖ Download in multiple browsers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Studio One import (requires manual adjustment)
