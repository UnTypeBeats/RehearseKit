## 🐛 Debugging Session (Fixed Issues)

### Issue 1: Missing Frontend Source Files
**Problem:** GitHub Actions couldn't find lib/websocket.ts  
**Fix:** Added frontend/lib/* files to git ✓

### Issue 2: ARM64 vs AMD64 Platform
**Problem:** Mac M1 builds ARM64, TrueNAS needs AMD64  
**Fix:** Used GitHub Actions for native AMD64 builds ✓

### Issue 3: CORS Configuration
**Problem:** Pydantic expected JSON array  
**Fix:** Removed from docker-compose, used code defaults ✓

### Issue 4: API URL Hardcoded
**Problem:** Frontend called localhost:8000  
**Fix:** Rebuilt with correct URL (10.0.0.155:30071) ✓

### Issue 5: Worker Redis Connection
**Problem:** Worker tried redis://redis:6379  
**Fix:** Updated to use 10.0.0.155:30059 ✓

### Issue 6: Mixed Content (HTTPS)
**Problem:** https://rehearsekit.uk couldn't call http:// API  
**Fix:** Smart API detection + Cloudflare tunnel config ✓

## 🎯 Next: Test Download (Once Job Completes)

### When Job Reaches COMPLETED

**Test download functionality:**
1. Click Download button
2. ZIP file should download
3. Extract and verify contents:
   - stems/ folder (4 WAV files at 48kHz)
   - .dawproject file
   - cubase/IMPORT_GUIDE.txt
   - README.txt with BPM
4. Open .dawproject in Studio One 7
5. Verify 48kHz sample rate ✓

### If Download Fails

**Likely causes:**
- File path permissions
- Storage path configuration
- Download endpoint CORS

**I'll help debug once the job completes!**
