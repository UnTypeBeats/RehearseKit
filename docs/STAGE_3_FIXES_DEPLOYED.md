**Fix Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Deployment Time:** 14:18 UTC+3  
**Status:** ALL ISSUES RESOLVED 🎉

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### **1. Stem Mixer - 404 Errors**

**Problem:**
```
GET /api/jobs/{id}/stems/vocals 404 (Not Found)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Stems saved to temporary `/tmp/` directories
- Directories deleted after job completion
- Mixer couldn't access stems for old jobs

**Fix:**
- Save stems to permanent storage: `/mnt/storage/rehearsekit/stems/{job_id}/`
- Update `stems_folder_path` to permanent location
- Stems now persist after job completion

**Code Changes:**
```python
# backend/app/tasks/audio_processing.py
permanent_stems_dir = os.path.join(
    settings.LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH,
    "stems",
    str(job_id)
)
os.makedirs(permanent_stems_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Copy stems to permanent location
for stem_file in Path(stems_dir).glob("*.wav"):
    shutil.copy2(stem_file, os.path.join(permanent_stems_dir, stem_file.name))
```

**Result:**
- ✅ New jobs: Stems available for mixer
- ✅ Old jobs: Graceful error message
- ✅ Permanent storage: Stems accessible anytime

---

### **2. Trimming - No Visual Feedback**

**Problem:**
- Trim controls visible but no indication trim will be applied
- Users confused about whether trimming works
- No confirmation that selected region will be processed

**Fix:**
- Added visual "✂️ Trim active" badge
- Show tip about selected region
- Display trim info on job details page
- Clear messaging throughout workflow

**UI Changes:**
```tsx
// Upload page - shows when trim is active
{trimStart !== null && trimEnd !== null && (
  <span className="text-xs text-blue-600 font-medium">
    ✂️ Trim active: Only selected region will be processed
  </span>
)}

// Job details page - shows trim was applied
{(job.trim_start !== null && job.trim_end !== null) && (
  <div className="p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-md border border-blue-200">
    ✂️ Audio Trimmed
    Start: 1:23 | End: 3:45 | Duration: 2:22
  </div>
)}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Clear visual feedback when trimming
- ✅ Users know what will be processed
- ✅ Trim info persisted and displayed

---

### **3. Stem Mixer - Poor UX**

**Problem:**
- No error handling for missing stems
- Design didn't match reference (vue-audio-mixer)
- Loading state unclear

**Fix:**
- Redesigned mixer layout (cleaner, more professional)
- Graceful error handling with helpful message
- Better volume slider positioning
- Improved waveform visualization
- Loading states with proper feedback

**Design Improvements:**
- Color-coded stem indicators (larger, more visible)
- Volume percentage display (MUTE vs 80%)
- Cleaner slider layout with icons
- Waveform in card background
- Better spacing and typography

**Error Handling:**
```tsx
// For old jobs without permanent stems
if (hasErrors && !allStemsLoaded) {
  return <Card>
    ⚠️ Stem files are not available for mixing
    This feature is only available for newly processed jobs.
    💡 To use the stem mixer, create a new job or reprocess this one.
  </Card>
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Professional mixer design
- ✅ Graceful degradation for old jobs
- ✅ Clear user guidance
