# PRD vs Implementation Analysis

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Working MVP - Partial Implementation

## Executive Summary

The RehearseKit implementation has achieved ~60% of PRD specifications. Core audio processing pipeline works locally but has significant gaps in format support, testing coverage, and production deployment stability.

## Gap Analysis

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Audio Processing Pipeline**
   - ✅ YouTube audio download (yt-dlp with anti-bot measures)
   - ✅ Audio conversion to 24-bit/48kHz WAV
   - ✅ Tempo/BPM detection (librosa)
   - ✅ Stem separation (Demucs htdemucs/htdemucs_ft models)
   - ✅ DAWproject file generation (.dawproject format)
   - ✅ ZIP package creation with stems

2. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - ✅ FastAPI REST API with async support
   - ✅ PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy
   - ✅ Celery task queue with Redis
   - ✅ WebSocket service for real-time progress
   - ✅ Job status tracking and management
   - ✅ Health check endpoints

3. **Frontend**
   - ✅ Next.js 14 with App Router
   - ✅ Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
   - ✅ Job creation interface
   - ✅ Job list and detail pages
   - ✅ Progress tracking with WebSocket updates
   - ✅ Download functionality

4. **Deployment**
   - ✅ Docker Compose for local development
   - ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for Cloud Run
   - ✅ Terraform infrastructure code

### ❌ Missing/Incomplete Features

#### 1. Audio Format Support (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** "Upload FLAC files or YouTube music video URLs"

**Current State:**
- Backend: Hard-coded `.flac` only check (`backend/app/api/jobs.py:34`)
- Frontend: File input restricted to `.flac` only (`frontend/components/audio-uploader.tsx:152`)
- Storage: Filename assumes `.flac` extension (`backend/app/services/storage.py:24`)

**Gap:**
- No support for MP3 (most common format)
- No support for WAV (lossless alternative)
- Limited user flexibility

**Impact:** Users must convert audio to FLAC before upload, creating friction

**Solution:** Accept MP3, WAV, and FLAC (FFmpeg already handles all formats in conversion step)

#### 2. Stem Separation Quality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** "Isolates vocals, drums, bass, guitars, keys, and other instruments" (6+ stems)

**Current State:**
- Demucs outputs 4 stems: vocals, drums, bass, other
- "Other" track combines: guitars (distorted/clean), keys, synths, ambient sounds

**Gap:**
- Cannot separate guitar types
- Cannot separate keys from other melodic instruments
- Reduces rehearsal utility for guitarists/keyboardists

**Impact:** Musicians must manually isolate parts from "other" track in DAW

**Future Options:**
- Demucs 6-stem model (requires custom training)
- Multi-model approach (Demucs + Spleeter)
- Multi-pass processing
- Hybrid ensemble methods

**Decision:** Document limitation, defer to future iteration (computational cost vs. benefit)

#### 3. Testing Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PRD Implies:** Production-ready quality with comprehensive testing

**Current State:**
- Basic Playwright test: `frontend/e2e/job-creation.spec.ts` (job creation only)
- No end-to-end flow testing (upload → process → download)
- No format validation testing
- No error handling testing
- No WebSocket progress testing
- No visual regression testing

**Gap:**
- Cannot verify complete user journey
- No confidence in format support changes
- Manual testing required for every change
- Production bugs slip through

**Impact:** Deployment failures, user-facing bugs, regression risk

**Solution:** Comprehensive Playwright E2E test suite

#### 4. Production Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** Self-hosted web application

**Current State:**
- ✅ Local Docker Compose: Works
- ⚠️ GCP Cloud Run: Frequent failures
- ❌ TrueNAS SCALE: Not configured

**GCP Issues (Observed):**
- Worker container fails with dependency errors
- WebSocket connections drop
- Cloud SQL connection timeouts
- VPC connector misconfigurations
- File upload size limits exceeded
- Environment variable propagation issues

**TrueNAS Requirements:**
- Custom Docker Compose app deployment
- Integration with existing PostgreSQL database
- Dataset configuration for persistent storage
- SMB/SSH access for debugging
- Health monitoring

**Gap:**
- No stable production deployment path
- GCP costs escalating without reliability
- TrueNAS (user's actual deployment target) not configured

**Solution:**
- Focus on TrueNAS deployment (user has physical access)
- Document GCP issues for future resolution
- Create TrueNAS-specific deployment configuration

#### 5. File Upload UX (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** "Drag-and-drop or file browser"

**Current State:**
- ✅ Drag-and-drop implemented
- ✅ File browser implemented
- ❌ Progress indicator during upload missing
- ❌ Large file upload handling unclear
- ❌ Upload cancellation not supported

**Gap:** User experience for large files (>100MB) is poor

#### 6. Job Management Features (LOW PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** "Job Cleanup: Automatic deletion after configurable retention period"

**Current State:**
- `JOB_RETENTION_DAYS` config exists (`backend/app/core/config.py:40`)
- No cleanup cron job implemented
- `delete_job` endpoint has TODO comment for file deletion (`backend/app/api/jobs.py:133`)

**Gap:** Jobs accumulate indefinitely, storage bloat

#### 7. Error Handling & Recovery (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** "Retry logic: Automatic retry for transient failures (3 attempts)"

**Current State:**
- Celery task retry not configured
- YouTube download has basic retry in yt-dlp config
- No circuit breaker patterns
- No graceful degradation

**Gap:** Transient failures cause permanent job failure

#### 8. Monitoring & Observability (LOW PRIORITY)

**PRD Specification:** "Health checks: `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring"

**Current State:**
- ✅ Basic health endpoint exists
- ❌ No metrics collection (Prometheus)
- ❌ No logging aggregation
- ❌ No alerting
- ❌ No performance monitoring

**Gap:** Cannot diagnose production issues

2. ✅ Comprehensive Playwright E2E tests
3. ✅ Test validation on local Docker

### Phase 2: Documentation
4. ✅ Document stem separation limitations
5. ✅ Document GCP deployment issues

### Phase 3: TrueNAS Deployment
6. ✅ Create TrueNAS Docker Compose configuration
7. ✅ Build and publish Docker images to Docker Hub
8. ✅ Write TrueNAS deployment guide
9. ✅ Deploy and validate on TrueNAS

### Future Phases (Deferred)
- Advanced stem separation (multi-model approach)
- GCP deployment fixes
- Job cleanup automation
- Upload progress indicators
- Monitoring and alerting

## Success Criteria

**MVP Complete When:**
- ✅ Accepts MP3, WAV, FLAC files
- ✅ Complete E2E test suite passes
- ✅ Deployed successfully on TrueNAS SCALE
- ✅ Can process audio end-to-end without manual intervention
- ✅ Documentation covers known limitations

**Production Ready When (Future):**
- Advanced stem separation implemented
- GCP deployment stable
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- Automated job cleanup
- 99% uptime SLA

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation but requires:
1. **Immediate:** Format support expansion and testing
2. **Short-term:** TrueNAS deployment configuration
3. **Long-term:** Stem quality improvements and production hardening

The plan focuses on achieving a working MVP on TrueNAS before tackling advanced features or GCP fixes.
