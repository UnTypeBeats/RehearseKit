## 💡 Tips for Production Use

### Performance

**Processing Time Estimates:**
- 3-minute song: 3-7 minutes total
- 5-minute song: 5-12 minutes total
- 10-minute song: 10-20 minutes total

**Slowest Stage:** SEPARATING (60-80% of total time)

### Resource Usage

**Per Job:**
- CPU: 2-4 cores during separation
- RAM: 2-4 GB during separation
- Storage: ~500 MB per job (stems + package)

**Recommendations:**
- Process one job at a time for best quality
- Clean up old jobs regularly (use Delete button)
- Monitor disk space on TrueNAS

### Best Practices

**File Formats:**
- MP3: Most common, good quality
- WAV: Lossless, larger files
- FLAC: Lossless, compressed, recommended

**Quality Modes:**
- Fast: 2-5 minutes, good for testing
- High: 5-12 minutes, better separation quality
