### 2. Create a Job

Visit http://localhost:3000 or use API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/create \
  -F "project_name=My Song" \
  -F "quality_mode=fast" \
  -F "input_url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

### 3. Download Results

Check `tmp/storage/` for the ZIP package containing:

## 🎯 Performance

### Benchmarks (19-second test clip)

- **Total Time**: 90 seconds
- **Ratio**: 4.7x real-time (fast mode)
- **Bottleneck**: Stem separation (78% of time)
- **Memory**: ~600 MB peak (worker)
- **Disk**: ~200 MB temp during processing

### Expected for 3-minute song

- **Fast mode**: ~5-8 minutes
- **High quality**: ~12-18 minutes

---

## 🔧 Known Limitations

### Current Scope

1. **Stem Count**: 4 stems (vocals, drums, bass, other)
   - "other" includes guitars, keys, synths
   - Future: 6-stem model or additional separation

2. **DAW Support**: DAWproject format
   - Works with: Cubase, Bitwig, Studio One
   - Future: Native Cubase .cpr, Ableton .als

3. **WebSocket**: Infrastructure ready, pub/sub needs verification
   - Fallback: Polling works (5s interval)

4. **File Serving**: Download returns path, not file stream
   - Works locally via file system
   - Future: Proper file serving endpoint

### Not Yet Implemented

- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Usage quotas
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Stem preview player
- [ ] Manual BPM override UI
- [ ] Project history/favorites
- [ ] Payment integration

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Decisions

1. **DAWproject over .cpr**: Open standard is more reliable than reverse-engineering
2. **Torch 2.2.0 + NumPy 1.x**: Compatibility constraints for Demucs
3. **FLAC intermediate**: Demucs outputs FLAC, we convert to WAV
4. **Async SQLAlchemy**: Required postgresql+asyncpg driver
5. **Enum lowercase**: Database enum values must match case

### Performance Insights

1. Demucs is the bottleneck (70-80% of processing time)
2. Model download on first run (~80 MB, one-time)
3. Fast mode is 2-3x faster than high quality
4. Memory usage scales with audio length

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)

- [ ] Test with 3-5 minute songs
- [ ] Test FLAC file upload
- [ ] Verify WebSocket real-time updates in browser
- [ ] Test high-quality mode

### Short Term

- [ ] Deploy to GCP
- [ ] Configure domain (rehearsekit.uk)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Long Term

- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Additional DAW formats
- [ ] 6-stem separation
- [ ] Stem preview player
- [ ] Key/time signature detection
- [ ] Batch processing

## 🎵 Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| YouTube → Stems | Working | ✅ Working | ✅ |
| Tempo Detection | Working | ✅ Working (234 BPM) | ✅ |
| DAW Integration | Working | ✅ DAWproject | ✅ |
| Processing Speed (Fast) | ≤2.5x | 4.7x | ⚠️ |
| Success Rate | ≥95% | 100% (limited testing) | ✅ |
| Services Health | All healthy | ✅ All healthy | ✅ |

**Note**: Processing speed of 4.7x is acceptable for MVP. Optimization can improve this.
