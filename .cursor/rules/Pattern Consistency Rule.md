# Pattern Consistency Rule - UNBREAKABLE

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **MUST follow established patterns in the codebase**
- **MUST maintain consistency with existing architecture**
- **MUST NOT introduce new patterns without justification**
- **MUST document any pattern changes**
- **Any pattern violation = IMMEDIATE VIOLATION**

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Before Implementing ANY Feature:
1. **MUST ask**: "What patterns exist for this type of feature?"
2. **MUST review**: Existing implementations of similar features
3. **MUST identify**: Established conventions and approaches
4. **MUST state**: "Following established pattern: [pattern name]"

### During Implementation:
1. **MUST follow**: Established patterns and conventions
2. **MUST maintain**: Consistency with existing code
3. **MUST verify**: "Am I following established patterns?"
4. **MUST document**: Any deviations from patterns

### After Implementation:
1. **MUST verify**: "Have I maintained consistency?"
2. **MUST document**: Any new patterns introduced
3. **MUST justify**: Any pattern changes made
4. **MUST update**: Pattern documentation if needed

## SELF-CHECKING REQUIREMENTS

### Before Implementing ANY Code:
1. **MUST ask**: "What patterns exist for this type of work?"
2. **MUST review**: Similar implementations in the codebase
3. **MUST identify**: Established conventions to follow
4. **MUST confirm**: "I understand the established patterns"

### During Implementation:
1. **MUST ask**: "Am I following established patterns?"
2. **MUST verify**: "Is this consistent with existing code?"
3. **MUST check**: "Am I introducing new patterns unnecessarily?"
4. **MUST confirm**: "This follows established conventions"

### After Implementation:
1. **MUST ask**: "Have I maintained consistency?"
2. **MUST verify**: "Does this fit with existing patterns?"
3. **MUST document**: Any new patterns introduced
4. **MUST justify**: Any pattern changes made

## PATTERN CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

### Must Follow:
- **Naming conventions** established in the codebase
- **Code structure** patterns used elsewhere
- **API design** patterns and conventions
- **Database schema** patterns and approaches
- **Error handling** patterns and conventions
- **Testing patterns** and approaches

### Must Maintain:
- **Consistency** with existing implementations
- **Coherence** across the entire codebase
- **Predictability** for future developers
- **Maintainability** through consistent patterns
- **Readability** through established conventions

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### If You Violate Patterns:
- **MUST acknowledge**: The pattern violation immediately
- **MUST review**: Established patterns in the codebase
- **MUST refactor**: Code to follow established patterns
- **MUST document**: Pattern restoration process
- **MUST apologize**: For pattern violation

### If You Introduce New Patterns:
- **MUST justify**: Why new pattern is necessary
- **MUST document**: The new pattern and its rationale
- **MUST ensure**: New pattern is consistent with existing ones
- **MUST update**: Pattern documentation
- **MUST NOT proceed**: Without proper justification

## ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **NEVER introduce new patterns without justification**
- **MUST follow established patterns in the codebase**
- **MUST maintain consistency with existing architecture**
- **Any pattern violation = immediate acknowledgment and correction required**

**This rule ensures codebase coherence and prevents fragmentation that makes maintenance difficult.**
