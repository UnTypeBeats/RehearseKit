# Context Preservation Rule - UNBREAKABLE

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **MUST maintain context across ALL interactions**
- **MUST reference previous decisions and implementations**
- **MUST NOT lose track of current state or progress**
- **MUST connect new work to existing patterns**
- **Any loss of context = IMMEDIATE VIOLATION**

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Before Starting ANY New Task:
1. **MUST ask**: "What's the current context?"
2. **MUST review**: Previous decisions and implementations
3. **MUST identify**: How new work connects to existing patterns
4. **MUST state**: "Building on previous context: [summary]"

### During Work:
1. **MUST maintain**: Awareness of current state
2. **MUST reference**: Previous decisions when making new ones
3. **MUST connect**: New implementations to existing patterns
4. **MUST document**: Context changes as they happen

### After Completion:
1. **MUST summarize**: What context was preserved
2. **MUST identify**: What context should be preserved for next session
3. **MUST document**: Key decisions and their rationale
4. **MUST prepare**: Context for future work

## SELF-CHECKING REQUIREMENTS

### Before Starting ANY Work:
1. **MUST ask**: "What's the current state of the project?"
2. **MUST review**: Recent changes and decisions
3. **MUST identify**: What patterns exist for this type of work?
4. **MUST confirm**: "I understand the current context"

### During Work:
1. **MUST ask**: "How does this connect to existing patterns?"
2. **MUST verify**: "Am I maintaining consistency with previous decisions?"
3. **MUST check**: "Am I building on established foundations?"
4. **MUST confirm**: "This aligns with existing context"

### After Work:
1. **MUST ask**: "What context should be preserved?"
2. **MUST document**: Key decisions and rationale
3. **MUST prepare**: Context for next session
4. **MUST confirm**: "Context is preserved for future work"

## CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

### Must Preserve:
- **Current project state** and progress
- **Previous decisions** and their rationale
- **Established patterns** and conventions
- **User requirements** and constraints
- **Technical architecture** decisions
- **Implementation approaches** used

### Must Connect:
- **New work** to existing patterns
- **Current decisions** to previous ones
- **Implementation choices** to established conventions
- **New features** to existing architecture
- **Current progress** to overall goals

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### If You Lose Context:
- **MUST acknowledge**: The context loss immediately
- **MUST review**: Previous work and decisions
- **MUST reconnect**: New work to existing patterns
- **MUST document**: Context restoration process
- **MUST apologize**: For context loss

### If You Violate This Rule:
- **MUST stop**: Current work immediately
- **MUST restore**: Context before proceeding
- **MUST reconnect**: Work to existing patterns
- **MUST document**: Context restoration
- **MUST NOT proceed**: Until context is fully restored

## ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **NEVER lose track of current state or progress**
- **MUST maintain context across ALL interactions**
- **MUST connect new work to existing patterns**
- **Any context loss = immediate acknowledgment and restoration required**

**This rule ensures continuous flow and prevents context switching overhead that breaks coding momentum.**
