# User Experience First Rule - UNBREAKABLE

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **MUST prioritize user experience over technical elegance**
- **MUST consider user workflow in all decisions**
- **MUST NOT optimize for code without considering UX**
- **MUST validate UX decisions with user perspective**
- **Any UX violation = IMMEDIATE VIOLATION**

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Before Implementing ANY Feature:
1. **MUST ask**: "How does this improve user experience?"
2. **MUST consider**: User workflow and needs
3. **MUST identify**: User value and benefits
4. **MUST state**: "This improves UX by: [benefit]"

### During Development:
1. **MUST prioritize**: User experience over technical elegance
2. **MUST consider**: How users will interact with this
3. **MUST verify**: "Am I making this easier for users?"
4. **MUST confirm**: "This enhances user experience"

### After Implementation:
1. **MUST verify**: "Does this actually help users?"
2. **MUST consider**: User feedback and usage patterns
3. **MUST evaluate**: "Is this user-friendly?"
4. **MUST confirm**: "User experience is improved"

## SELF-CHECKING REQUIREMENTS

### Before Implementing ANY Feature:
1. **MUST ask**: "How does this improve user experience?"
2. **MUST consider**: User workflow and needs
3. **MUST identify**: User value and benefits
4. **MUST confirm**: "This provides user value"

### During Development:
1. **MUST ask**: "Am I making this easier for users?"
2. **MUST verify**: "Is this user-friendly?"
3. **MUST check**: "Does this enhance user workflow?"
4. **MUST confirm**: "This improves user experience"

### After Implementation:
1. **MUST ask**: "Does this actually help users?"
2. **MUST verify**: "Is this user-friendly?"
3. **MUST evaluate**: "Does this enhance user experience?"
4. **MUST confirm**: "User experience is improved"

## USER EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS

### Must Prioritize:
- **User workflow** and ease of use
- **User needs** and pain points
- **User value** and benefits
- **User feedback** and usage patterns
- **User accessibility** and inclusivity
- **User performance** and responsiveness

### Must Consider:
- **How users will interact** with the feature
- **What problems** this solves for users
- **How this fits** into user workflow
- **What value** this provides to users
- **How this enhances** user experience
- **What feedback** users might have

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### If You Ignore UX:
- **MUST acknowledge**: The UX violation immediately
- **MUST reconsider**: User experience implications
- **MUST refactor**: Code to prioritize user experience
- **MUST document**: UX improvements made
- **MUST apologize**: For ignoring user experience

### If You Optimize for Code Over UX:
- **MUST acknowledge**: The violation immediately
- **MUST reconsider**: User experience priorities
- **MUST refactor**: Code to serve user needs
- **MUST verify**: "Does this actually help users?"
- **MUST NOT proceed**: Until UX is prioritized

## ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **NEVER optimize for code without considering UX**
- **MUST prioritize user experience over technical elegance**
- **MUST consider user workflow in all decisions**
- **MUST validate UX decisions with user perspective**
- **Any UX violation = immediate acknowledgment and correction required**

**This rule ensures all development serves user needs and creates value for the people who will actually use the system.**
